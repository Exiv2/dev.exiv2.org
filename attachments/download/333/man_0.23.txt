NAME
       exiv2 - Image metadata manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       exiv2 [options] [action] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       exiv2  is a program to read and write Exif, IPTC and XMP image metadata
       and image comments. The following image formats are supported:

       JP2    Read/Write   Read/Write   Read/Write   -

       o Support for GIF, TGA and BMP images is minimal: the image  format  is
         recognized,  a  MIME  type assigned to it and the height and width of
         the image are determined.

       o Reading other TIFF-like RAW image formats, which are  not  listed  in
         the table, may also work.

ACTIONS
       The  action  argument  is  only  required  if  it is not clear from the
       options which action is implied.

       pr | print
              Print image metadata. This is the default action, i.e., the com-
              mand  exiv2  image.jpg  will  print  a summary of the image Exif
              metadata.

       ex | extract
              Extract metadata to *.exv, XMP  sidecar  (*.xmp)  and  thumbnail
              image files.  Modification commands can be applied on-the-fly.

       in | insert
              Insert  metadata  from  corresponding *.exv, XMP sidecar (*.xmp)
              and thumbnail files.  Use option -S .suf to change the suffix of
              the input files. Since files of any supported format can be used
              as input files, this command can be used to  copy  the  metadata
              between files of different formats. Modification commands can be
              applied on-the-fly.

       rm | delete
              Delete image metadata from the files.

       ad | adjust
              Adjust Exif timestamps by the given time. Requires at least  one
              of the options -a time, -Y yrs, -O mon or -D day.

       mo | modify
              Apply  commands  to modify (add, set, delete) the Exif, IPTC and
              XMP metadata of image files. Requires option -c, -m or -M.

       mv | rename
              Rename files and/or set file timestamps according  to  the  Exif
              create timestamp. Uses the value of tag Exif.Photo.DateTimeOrig-
              inal or, if not present, Exif.Image.DateTime  to  determine  the
              timestamp. The filename format can be set with -r fmt, timestamp
              options are -t and -T.

       fi | fixiso
              Copy the ISO setting from one of the proprietary Nikon or  Canon
              makernote    ISO   tags   to   the   regular   Exif   ISO   tag,
              Exif.Photo.ISOSpeedRatings. Does not overwrite an existing stan-
              dard Exif ISO tag.

       fc | fixcom
              Fix  the  character  encoding  of  Exif  Unicode  user comments.
              Decodes the comment using the auto-detected or specified charac-
              ter encoding and writes it back in UCS-2. Use option -n to spec-
              ify the current encoding of the comment if necessary.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display help and exit.

       -V     Show the program version and exit.

       -v     Be verbose during the program run.

       -q     Silence warnings and error messages from the Exiv2 library  dur-
              ing  the program run (quiet). Note that options -v and -q can be
              used at the same time.

       -Q lvl Set the log-level to 'd'(ebug), 'i'(nfo), 'w'(arning), 'e'(rror)
              or  'm'(ute). The default log-level is 'w'. -Qm is equivalent to
              -q. All log messages are written to standard error.

       -b     Show large binary values (default is to suppress them).

       -u     Show unknown tags (default is to suppress tags which don't  have
              a name).

       -g key Only  output info for this Exiv2 key (grep). Multiple -g options
              can be used to grep info for several keys.

       -n enc Charset to use to decode Exif Unicode user comments.  enc  is  a
              name understood by iconv_open(3), e.g., 'UTF-8'.

       -k     Preserve file timestamps when updating files (keep). Can be used
              with all options which update files.  The  flag  is  ignored  by
              read-only options.

       -t     Set the file timestamp according to the Exif create timestamp in
              addition to renaming the file (overrides  -k).  This  option  is
              only used with the 'rename' action.

       -T     Only  set  the file timestamp according to the Exif create time-
              stamp, do not rename the file (overrides  -k).  This  option  is
              only  used  with  the  'rename' action. Note: On Windows you may
              have to set the TZ environment variable for this option to  work
              correctly.

       -f     Do  not  prompt  before  overwriting existing files (force over-
              write).

       -F     Do not prompt before renaming files (Force rename). Appends '_1'
              ('_2', ...) to the name of the new file.

       -a time
              Time  adjustment  in  the format [-]HH[:MM[:SS]]. This option is
              only used with the 'adjust' action. Examples: 1 adds  one  hour,
              1:01  adds  one  hour and one minute, -0:00:30 subtracts 30 sec-
              onds.

       -Y yrs Time adjustment by a positive or negative number of  years,  for
              the 'adjust' action.

       -O mon Time  adjustment by a positive or negative number of months, for
              the 'adjust' action.

       -D day Time adjustment by a positive or negative number  of  days,  for
              the 'adjust' action.

       -p mode
              Print mode for the 'print' action. Possible modes are:
              s : print a summary of the Exif metadata (the default)
              a : print Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata (shortcut for -Pkyct)
              t : interpreted (translated) Exif tags (-PEkyct)
              v : plain Exif tag values (-PExgnycv)
              h : hexdump of the Exif data (-PExgnycsh)
              i : IPTC datasets (-PIkyct)
              x : XMP properties (-PXkyct)
              c : JPEG comment
              p  : list available image previews, sorted by preview image size
              in pixels

       -P flgs
              Print flags for fine control of the tag list  ('print'  action).
              Allows  control  of the type of metadata as well as data columns
              included in the print output.  Valid flags are:
              E : include Exif tags in the list
              I : IPTC datasets
              X : XMP properties
              x : print a column with the tag number
              g : group name
              k : key
              l : tag label
              n : tag name
              y : type
              c : number of components (count)
              s : size in bytes
              v : plain data value
              t : interpreted (translated) data
              h : hexdump of the data

       -d tgt Delete target(s) for the 'delete' action. Possible targets are:
              a : all supported metadata (the default)
              e : Exif section
              t : Exif thumbnail only
              i : IPTC data
              x : XMP packet
              c : JPEG comment

       -i tgt Insert target(s) for the 'insert' action. Possible  targets  are
              the same as those for the -d option, plus a modifier:
              X  :  Insert  metadata  from an XMP sidecar file <file>.xmp. The
              remaining insert targets determine what metadata to insert  from
              the  sidecar  file.  Possible  are  Exif,  IPTC  and XMP and the
              default is all of these. Note that the inserted  XMP  properties
              include those converted to Exif and IPTC.
              Only JPEG thumbnails can be inserted (not TIFF thumbnails), they
              need to be named file-thumb.jpg.

       -e tgt Extract target(s) for the 'extract' action. Possible targets are
              the  same  as  those for the -d option, plus a target to extract
              preview images and a modifier to generate an XMP sidecar file:
              p[<n>[,<m> ...]] : Extract preview images.  The  optional  comma
              separated  list  of  preview  image numbers is used to determine
              which preview images to extract. The  available  preview  images
              and their numbers are displayed with the 'print' option -pp.
              X  :  Extract  metadata  to  an XMP sidecar file <file>.xmp. The
              remaining extract targets determine what metadata to extract  to
              the  sidecar  file.  Possible  are  Exif,  IPTC  and XMP and the
              default is all of these.

       -r fmt Filename format for the 'rename' action. The format string  fol-
              lows strftime(3) and supports the following keywords:
              :basename:   - original filename without extension
              :dirname:    - name of the directory holding the original file
              :parentname: - name of parent directory
              Default filename format is %Y%m%d_%H%M%S.

       -c txt JPEG  comment string to set in the image ('modify' action). This
              option can also be used with the 'extract' and 'insert'  actions
              to modify metadata on-the-fly.

       -m file
              Command  file  for  the 'modify' action. This option can also be
              used with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify  metadata
              on-the-fly.

       -M cmd Command  line  for  the 'modify' action. This option can also be
              used with the 'extract' and 'insert' actions to modify  metadata
              on-the-fly.   The format for the commands is the same as that of
              the lines of a command file.

       -l dir Location (directory) for files to be inserted or extracted.

       -S .suf
              Use suffix .suf for source files in 'insert' action.

COMMANDS
       Commands for the 'modify' action can be read from a command file, e.g.,

          exiv2 -m cmd.txt image.jpg

       or given on the command line, as in

          exiv2 -M"add Iptc.Application2.Credit String Mr. Smith" image.jpg

       Note the quotes. Multiple -m and -M options can be combined.

       When writing Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata, exiv2 enforces only a correct
       metadata structure. It is possible to write tags with types and  values
       different  from  those specified in the standards, duplicate Exif tags,
       undefined tags, or incomplete metadata. While exiv2 is able to read all
       metadata  that  it can write, other programs may have difficulties with
       images that contain non standard-conforming metadata.

   Command format
       The format of a command is

       set | add | del key [[type] value]

       set    Set the value of an existing tag with a matching key or add  the
              tag.

       add    Add a tag (unless key is a non-repeatable IPTC key; nothing pre-
              vents you from adding duplicate Exif tags).

       del    Delete all occurrences of a tag (requires only a key).

       key    Exiv2 Exif, IPTC or XMP key.

       type   Byte | Ascii | Short | Long | Rational | Undefined  |  SShort  |
              SLong | SRational | Comment for Exif keys,
              String | Date | Time | Short | Undefined for IPTC keys, and
              XmpText | XmpAlt | XmpBag | XmpSeq | LangAlt for XMP keys.

              A  default type is used if none is explicitly given. The default
              is determined based on key.

       value  The remaining text on the line is the value. It  can  optionally
              be   enclosed  in  single  quotes  ('value')  or  double  quotes
              ("value").

              The value is optional. Not providing any value is equivalent  to
              an  empty value ("") and is mainly useful to create an XMP array
              property, e.g., a bag.

              The format of Exif Comment values includes an  optional  charset
              specification at the beginning:

              [charset=Ascii|Jis|Unicode|Undefined ]comment

              Undefined  is  used by default if the value doesn't start with a
              charset definition.

              The format for IPTC Date  values  is  YYYY-MM-DD  (year,  month,
              day),  that  for  IPTC  Time  values  is HH:MM:SS+|-HH:MM, where
              HH:MM:SS refers to local hour, minute and seconds  and  +|-HH:MM
              refers  to  hours  and minutes ahead or behind Universal Coordi-
              nated Time (+|- means either a + or a - sign is required).

              The format of XMP LangAlt values includes an  optional  language
              qualifier:

              [lang=language-code ]text

              x-default  is  used by default if the value doesn't start with a
              language qualifier.

       An additional command is available to register XMP namespaces:

       reg prefix namespace

   Command file format
       Empty lines and lines starting with # in a  command  file  are  ignored
       (comments). Remaining lines are commands as described above.

EXAMPLES
       exiv2 *.jpg
              Prints  a  summary of the Exif information for all JPEG files in
              the directory.

       exiv2 -pi image.jpg
              Prints the IPTC metadata of the image.

       exiv2 rename img_1234.jpg
              Renames  img_1234.jpg  (taken  on  13-Nov-05  at  22:58:31)   to
              20051113_225831.jpg

       exiv2 -r':basename:_%Y%m' rename img_1234.jpg
              Renames img_1234.jpg to img_1234_200511.jpg

       exiv2 -et img1.jpg img2.jpg
              Extracts   the   Exif   thumbnails   from  the  two  files  into
              img1-thumb.jpg and img2-thumb.jpg.

       exiv2 -it img1.jpg img2.jpg
              Inserts (copies) metadata from img1.exv  to  img1.jpg  and  from
              img2.exv to img2.jpg.

       exiv2 -ep1,2 image.jpg
              Extracts previews 1 and 2 from the image to the files image-pre-
              view1.jpg and image-preview2.jpg.

       exiv2 -eiX image.jpg
              Extracts IPTC datasets into an XMP sidecar file image.xmp and in
              the process converts them to "IPTC Core" XMP schema.

       exiv2 -iixX image.jpg
              Inserts IPTC and XMP metadata from an XMP sidecar file image.xmp
              into image.jpg.  The resulting IPTC datasets are converted  from
              the "IPTC Core" XMP schema properties in the sidecar file to the
              older IPTC IIM4 format.  The  inserted  XMP  properties  include
              those in the "IPTC Core" XMP schema.

       exiv2 -M"set Exif.Photo.UserComment charset=Ascii New Exif comment" image.jpg
              Sets the Exif comment to an ASCII string.

       exiv2 -M"set Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitude 4/1 15/1 33/1" \
              -M"set Exif.GPSInfo.GPSLatitudeRef N" image.jpg
              Sets the latitude to 4 degrees, 15 minutes and 33 seconds north.
              The Exif standard stipulates that the GPSLatitude  tag  consists
              of  three  Rational numbers for the degrees, minutes and seconds
              of the latitude and GPSLatitudeRef contains either  'N'  or  'S'
              for north or south latitude respectively.

       exiv2 insert -l/tmp -S.CRW /data/*.JPG
              Copy  all  metadata  from CRW files in the /tmp directory to JPG
              files with corresponding basenames in the /data directory.  Note
              that  this  copies  metadata as is, without any modifications to
              adapt it to the requirements of the  target  format.  Some  tags
              copied like this may not make sense in the target image.
