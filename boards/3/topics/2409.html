<h2>Is there a master list that tells what photo editor/manager software reads and stores IPTC Plus and Extension?</h2>

<div class="wiki">
<p>Greetings all,<br />My first post - recently I've become quite aware of my metadata because I've lost some of it. I've been using ACDSee for 10-12 years and recently a bug has come up - and it's an ugly one.</p>


	<p>In my case, I haven't done any photo editing in over a year. But I did update to the latest version of ACDSee Pro 8 and was browsing through my pics. It seems that if you even call up a pic in the viewer (no edits done, no saving done) IPTC data gets wiped out. A man on the forum said he did some batch tagging and lost some of his EXIF data. Very bad for ACD and their followers. If we change to different photo mgr, we lost some ACD specific data - Categories. These are unique to ACD. But I'm faced with looking at a new software manager. Who knows when this bug will be fixed.</p>


	<p>That's why I asked my question in subject line. I cam upon a list that did just that yesterday. Dummy me - I didn't bookmark it cuz I had about 20 tabs open and was doing lots of research. The site is not in my history either. Not in my cache either. But, I figure if anyone has a list like this by photo app - it would be you guys.</p>


	<p>So I d/l a trial of Camera Bits because they were on the list that stored Plus and Extension for IPTC. But I discovered that one of their IPTC data fields is stored is a different place than ACD - a place I think is not logical.</p>


	<p>I'm attaching screen shots that compares ACD IPTC info and Camera Bits IPTC info of the same pic. You'll see what I mean.</p>


	<p>One other thing. I'd love to have a Template, by IPTC category, that lists all data fields. I've tried 5 different photo managers and most of them don't do a good job of separating their IPTC and EXIF data, so I'm really confused about what comes from where.</p>


	<p>Once again, I think if anyone would have such a template, it would be you.</p>


	<p>I'm attaching screen shots to show you the difference in where Camera Bits stores Date Created vs. ACDSee</p>


	<p>Thanks for any help on my questions/issues. I have a feeling I'm going to be on your forum a lot for awhile.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Hi Cathy</p>


	<p>I have not seen a master list and I'll have to look into IPTC Plus. A sample image with that metadata included would help.</p>


	<p>That said, I did add support for ACD Categories to exiv2 version 0.25 and the Digikam team included it as well, so you do have that alternative.</p>


	<p>Digikam does a stellar job of reading and syncing all kinds of metadata and goes as far as following MWG guidelines, so I think you and other ACD users would be well served in migrating to that application. It is Free Software.</p></div>

	<p>I <em>did</em> include 4 screenshots with that post. Can u take a look again? To think that I can see them on the message, but you can't....<br />The screen shots are really needed for you to see what I'm talking about.</p>


	<p>If you still can't see them, try logging out of windows, then come back in and sign in to windows. Then sign in to the forum.</p>


	<p>Please let me know if you're able to see the images then.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Sure thing. Here it is. But please note - ALL of my pics that have IPTC created date show up under Events in Camera Bits. I took a couple of shots with both of my cameras yesterday as a test, and they had NOTHING when I looked at IPTC data in ACD, and only had the Event date in Camera bits Photo Mechanic.<br />I've learned something w/ ACDSee. If I enter keywords, caption, description, anything in the IPTC <strong>Content</strong> section, then the Date Created field is populated in the Pic.<br />I just did it with two pics. But I would sure like to have a photo app that would show me more IPTC data. Photo Mechanic displays LOTS of info, but I still say it was a major oversight to omit Date Created from IPTC Content category.</p>


	<p>I'm also gonna send u a pic that has NO Date Created - in ACDSee it shows NO IPTC data. <br />I'm using Exif Pilot to review the metadata, but I'd sure like to have something that shows me more data.</p>

	<p>Dates and Times are actually stored in EXIF, listing them under IPTC is an error on the part of ACDSee.</p>


	<p>For correct handling of Date/Time fields, I recommend reading the MWG Guidelines: <a class="external" href="http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/pdf/mwg_guidance.pdf#page=37">http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/pdf/mwg_guidance.pdf#page=37</a></p>


	<p>As I said previously, Digikam is my recommended photo management application. Bonus is that it will see your ACDSee Categories and import them into industry standard XMP hierarchical keywords. You can read about those in the MWG guidelines as well.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I haven't really understood this thread.  I'm the build engineer for Exiv2 and don't know much about metadata.  As Alan has said, we're not a metadata forum.  Our focus is to provide a library for applications to reliably manipulate metadata.  The application exiv2(.exe) provides command-line access to most of the features of the library and is used by the test suite.  If you like command-line tools, you will find exiv2(.exe) useful in metadata investigations.</p>


	<p>I think you believe you are loosing metadata.  You might find the following command very useful to extract and preserve your metadata: <strong><code>$ exiv2 -ea image-path</code></strong>.  For example:<pre>1109 rmills@rmillsmbp:~/temp $ ls -alt Stonehenge.jpg 
-rw-r--r--+ 1 rmills  staff  6757827 15 Mar 20:42 Stonehenge.jpg
1110 rmills@rmillsmbp:~/temp $ exiv2 -ea Stonehenge.jpg 
1111 rmills@rmillsmbp:~/temp $ ls -alt Sto*
-rw-r--r--+ 1 rmills  staff    17989 16 Mar 15:51 Stonehenge.exv
-rw-r--r--+ 1 rmills  staff  6757827 15 Mar 20:42 Stonehenge.jpg
1112 rmills@rmillsmbp:~/temp $ </pre>The metadata has been extracted into Stonehenge.exv.  It can be restored into the image with the command: <strong><code>$ exiv2 insert Stonehenge.exv Stonehenge.jpg</code></strong>.  You can list the IPTC data in an image with the command <strong><code>$ exiv2 -pi image</code></strong>.  For example:<pre>1124 rmills@rmillsmbp:~/temp $ exiv2 -pi Stonehenge.jpg 
Iptc.Envelope.ModelVersion                   Short       1  4
Iptc.Envelope.CharacterSet                   String      3  G
Iptc.Application2.RecordVersion              Short       1  4
Iptc.Application2.Caption                    String     12  Classic View
1125 rmills@rmillsmbp:~/temp $ </pre>You can remove the IPTC data with the command: <strong><code>$ exiv2 -di image</code></strong>.</p>


	<p>I hope that helps you <em><strong>drill down</strong></em> into your issues.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Thanks to both of you. Talk about getting a CRASH course!!<br />Alan, I;m a little confused about the dates now. <br />I quote from your post:<br />"Dates and Times are actually stored in EXIF, listing them under IPTC is an error on the part of ACDSee."</p>


	<p>I'm attaching another screen print from Exif Pilot. It had great reviews on a few web sites. The screen I'm showing lists Date Created under IPTC info.  So if you're saying date and times are stored in EXIF, are you also saying that those data fields in IPTC that are date related are garbage?</p>


	<p>Man, I've got a lot to learn. And I've d/l your Exiv2.exe for Windows. I haven't used any of those commands since about 2002!!</p>


	<p>Let me know if you think Exif Pilot is giving me meaningful data.</p>


	<p>Thanks again.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>As some wit once said <strong><em>"I love Standards.  There are so many from which to choose!"</em></strong>  It's very likely that there is metadata duplicated in the three major Standards: Exif, IPTC and XMP.  And different applications will respect tags in the different Standards.  A confusing mess?  Yes, I'd say so.</p>


	<p>There was a discussion about 18 months ago concerning the <em><strong>"Title"</em></strong> of an Image.  Lots of applications, such as Picasa, provide a UI to give an image a <em><strong>"Title"</em></strong>.  I tried Lightroom, Preview.app (Mac), Picasa and some others.  There was little consistency.  Some stored <em><strong>"Title"</em></strong> in IPTC, some in Exif.  I was pleased to see, <em>because I'm a retired Adobe Engineer</em>, that Adobe applications were consistent.  So Lightroom, PhotoShop and Bridge all store <em><strong>"Title"</em></strong> in the same way.  <a class="external" href="http://dev.exiv2.org/boards/3/topics/2016?r=2017#message-2017">http://dev.exiv2.org/boards/3/topics/2016?r=2017#message-2017</a></p>


	<p>The Exiv2 project tries to keep out of this jungle.  We read and write metadata in a reliable manner and leave the application with the responsibility for the meaning and appropriate use of the metadata.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Wow. OK. Did u look at my Exif Pilot screen print Alan? It shows date created in the IPTC tab. Does that mean Pilot is not reliable for getting that data?</p>


	<p>Robin, WELL SAID. Standards, Smandards!!<br />My thoughts exactly. Well I have to run now, much as I hate to because this is getting more interesting by the moment. And again, I really appreciate all of you guys and your input. I obviously need to learn a lot about metadata.</p>


	<p>Alan, please do look at the Exif Pilot shot and tell me what u think of that app. I'm having permission problems running your Exiv2 program at the command prompt. Windows 10 Pro - I'm a geek going back to 1983. So I have lots of experience on almost all the Windows platforms. Windows 10 (and 8) are terrible with permissions. I'm in the Admin group, and I still have problems with about half the folders on the OS Drive.<br />I'm getting desperate, and thinking about just making myself OWNER on the entire C Drive!!! just kidding.... but that's another issue.<br />When I tried to run Exiv2 on the first pic it worked fine. On pic # 2 it says I don't have permission to access that pic. I even opened up my permissions to ALL on Program Files, and I still can't run Exiv on that pic.</p>


	<p>Later...</p>


	<p>I hope to have some more interesting revelations when I get back home.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>That's really curious that you can't run exiv2(.exe) on a file.  I wonder if that's a permission issue with exiv2(.exe) or the file itself.  Can you run the command and let me see the output.</p>


	<p>I've also had trouble with permissions on Windows 10.  I am an administrator and I used the drive explorer thing to recursively give myself "Full Permissions" (or whatever it's called).

	<p>Wow. OK. Did u look at my Exif Pilot screen print Alan? It shows date created in the IPTC tab. Does that mean Pilot is not reliable for getting that data?</p>

	<p>I suspect Exif Pilot is reading data from the EXIF Date/Time fields, converting it and displaying it as IPTC Date &#38; Time. That is correct according to the MWG, but the IPTC Date/Time data is not contained in the image provided. I'm not sure it matters though; EXIF and XMP have all the needed data making IPTC a bit redundant in my opinion.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I thank you for your kind words about DigiKam on behalf of our good friend Gilles.  Gilles is the custodian of DigiKam and a frequent contributor to Exiv2.  I'll send a private email to Gilles and ask him to read this thread.</p>


	<p>I believe Gilles usually defers metadata questions to Team Exiv2 as the <em><strong>metadata experts</strong></em>.  Gilles has many matters to deal with for DigiKam and metadata is only one horse he has to ride.  So, don't expect Gilles to jump to your rescue.  However he's very nice, very French, works very hard and is an all round great guy.  He might be able to suggest sources of information about metadata.  Phil (of exiftool) has a wonderful web site with lots of information about metadata.  <a class="external" href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/</a></p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Hi Cathy,</p>


	<p>About digiKam and ACDSee categories question, well yes, digiKam is able to import ACDSee categories as Tags in database, and may other in fact.</p>


	<p>We take a care about interoperability with other photo management softwares, when it's possible, as LightRoom, Aperture, Nikon NX, etc..</p>


	<p>With current stable 4.14.0, ACDSee metadata are imported as well if info are found, following and hard-coded order.</p>


	<p>With next 5.0.0, this is fully configurable in setup/metadata config panel. End users can set the order to import/export image metadata from/to digiKam database.</p>


	<p><a class="external" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/digikam/23393065632/in/dateposted-public/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/digikam/23393065632/in/dateposted-public/</a></p>


	<p>Also, digiKam 5.0.0 as a new mechanism to delay when you want the sync between database and image metadata. As metadata writing in image take a while, even if multicore CPU is used,<br />you can process changes about image properties in digiKam, as Rating, comments, Tags, Labels, and put your changes in a queue, which will be processed later, when you take a coffre, or dinner for ex.</p>


	<p>As you use ACDSee, i suppose that you use Windows. DigiKam is order of priority coded and tested under Linux, and after OSX, and finally Windows, when time permit. In fact, Windows porting is a very big puzzle, very more complex than Linux or OSX.<br />With 5.0.0, application have been ported to Qt 5.0 framework, which will simplify a lots the port and reduce the puzzle. We hope to provide quickly a Windows version to test.</p>


	<p>Best</p>

	<p>Importing ACDSee Categories as Hierarchical Keywords should be automatic with the current version (4.14) of Digikam. Which version do you have installed?</p></div>

	<p>There is no update of digiKam for Windows after 4.12.0. The reason is simple : the Windows packager left the project...</p>

	<p>M$ = Microsoft (:=)))</p>


	<p>Gimp is not digiKam. Gimp is an advanced photo editing software, like Photoshop. I know well, as i teach photo editing for Webmaster lessons in a computer science engineer school in France.</p>


	<p>digiKam is a photo-management software, as Aperture under OSX, or ACDSee under Windows. It's a middle and transverse software as it can edit a little bit photo (no layers support), process RAW files, edit metadata, export photo on the web services, process Panorama, and of course have a lots of search tools to find items in collection (keywords, colors, tags, quality, map, date, time-line, properties, etc...). It have also a light table to compare images side by side, a Batch queue manager to process image sets in your workflow, and a camera interface to select items from your removable devices and pre-process while downloading on you computer.<br />digiKam supports also virtual albums, based on tags, rating, picks and color labels.</p>


	<p>Currently, the best database support with digiKam is local one (SQlite based), but we working on Mysql support to be able to use remote database server in case of photo agency context.</p>


	<p>Darktable is a Raw processing software, as LightRoom is. Never tested in-deep as i found the graphical interface to much far than end users needs.</p>
