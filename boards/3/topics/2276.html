<p>I am doing something wrong because I am getting nowhere with this.  All the documentation shows what to do once you are accessing exiv2, not how to start.  I am using a PA.  I downloaded the windows version.  I double clicked on the application and says yes to extract all files.  I then double click on the application again, and it appears that a command prompt window briefly appears and then vanishes and I get nothing else.  Since it was said this is a command prompt application, I manually tried to open the command prompt window and eventually got it to work by changing the directory to where the program was downloaded to.  2 questions, is it supposed to come up with a command prompt window and stay open when you ckick on the application, and 2, Can you update the documentation to show how to get to the point where the manual starts?</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Yes I have a lot to learn.  I posted this because I wanted to learn to use this product, and I am not an expert on command prompt applications.  I also thought it would be helpful to you make a suggestion so people do not give up on your product because they cannot access it.  I asked questions so I could learn and they were not answered.  You too have a lot to learn.  You have to learn not to be rude and actually help people try to use exiv2.  You do not understand the value of a product is its use, and you do not understand the value of being a positive representative of a team.</p></div>

	<p>No, the command line prompt window (e.g., cmd on windows) is not part of the exiv2 utility. What you did is the way to go.</p>


<blockquote>

</blockquote>

	<p>The <a href="http://www.exiv2.org/manpage.html" class="external">manual page</a> is not meant to contain such information. There <em>is</em> in fact a note on the 'Getting started' page, which answers your first question: <em>"To get started with the Exiv2 command line utility, run it with the -h parameter from a terminal or cmd shell: exiv2 -h and study the samples here. For details, read the manual page."</em></p>


	<p>We do not have the resources nor interest to provide support for issues that are not related to this project. Read <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" class="external">this essay</a> to understand where we're coming from and feel free to come back when you have specific questions about Exiv2 itself; we're not actually rude people.</p>

	<p>I apologise for being so rude to you.  I can't imagine what I was thinking.  I'm normally patient and try to be helpful.  As Andreas has said, we'll help you with Exiv2 related stuff.  When you open the zip, it'll run exiv2.exe in a DOS window and exit.  Not very helpful.  What you should do is to extract it into a directory such as c:\Users\yourname\exiv2.  Then launch cmd.exe:<pre>
c:\&gt; cd \Users\yourname\exiv2
c:\Users\yourname\exiv2\&gt; exiv2 -h</pre>And you'll get some information about options for the program.  In the first instance, you'll almost certainly want to examine the metadata in an image on your computer.  The default option lists a summary:<pre>c:\Users\yourname\exiv2\&gt; exiv2 ..\Pictures\foo.jpg</pre>The option -pa lists all the metadata.<pre>exiv2 -pa ..\Pictures\foo.jpg</pre>Once you have the program working, you can explore some of the options.  A good read at the man page might put you to sleep, however you'll discover that we have options to read, modify and delete metadata in images of many types.  <a class="external" href="http://www.exiv2.org/manpage.html">http://www.exiv2.org/manpage.html</a></p>


	<p>Image metadata, like most things in software, is a more complex field than you might suspect.  There are 3 common standards supported by exiv2:  Exif, IPTC and XMP.  When I take a photo with my Nikon D5300, it typically stores about 160 items such as date/time, flash, lens, aperture, speed, focus, geo-location, camera model, preview image and lots more.  Oh, and it stores the image itself of course.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Thank you for your response.  I was able to play with it, and once I was comfortable with command prompts, I was able to use it without issue, following the manual.  My initial interest was the shutter count on a used D5200 I just purchased, but I see it is a very worthwhile program to have around.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Thanks, Dave.  You'll find there are lots of nice (free) programs such as Picasa, Adobe Bridge and DigiKam which provide metadata GUIs.  The exiv2 project's mission is provide the low-level library to be used by such applications.  DigiKam includes libexiv2.  We haven't been successful <em><strong>yet</strong></em> in persuading Google and Adobe to adopt libexiv2.</p>


	<p>The application exiv2.exe is used by our test suite and can exercise almost every feature of our code base.  Exiv2.exe is a useful application in it own right, however you've got to be a command-line guy to like this kind of thing.  We will never going provide a GUI for libexiv2 as the focus of our effort is to provide a robust and reliable library.  Developing GUIs is fun and time consuming.  We choose to keep out of that area.</p>


	<p>Good Luck and thank you for chatting on the Forum.</p></div>
