<h2>Getting 0.19.1 from svn -- still possible?</h2>

<div class="wiki">
<p>My Cygwin has this version installed. I just discovered my Linux laptop doesn't (it's still on 0.19). My original thinking was to bring them both up to 0.2.0, so I tried it in Cygwin first -- compile looked OK, but when I went to run it, I got similar errors to what Matthias Baas mentioned in thread # 630, and a stackdump on every command I tried. So having kept my 0.19.1 binary off to one side, I put that back in my /bin folder, trashed the 0.2.0 one, and wrote a few more scripts that make use of the <del>g option (which "straight" 0.19 didn't have yet). Now I'd like to upgrade the Linux -</del> running a very heavily-mod'ed Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty w/GNOME and KDE elements mixed ("peanut butter in the chocolate" is my phrase for it) -- and I'd like to "step lightly" in doing so. I've checked the issues and repositories/changelog pages, and I can't puzzle out how one should write a command to download a specific trunk or snapshot than the one on offer.</p>


	<p>A little help in this regard could go a long way. Scripts-wise, I've become somewhat of a "-g option addict."</p>


	<p>Another reason I'd like to hold off for a bit on going up to 0.2.0 is discussed in thread # 569 (error trapping). It'd be nice to see my namespaces "modes" idea implemented too (thread # 581), but that's more of an ornament, a once-in-a-while thing so far as how often I'd use it goes, compared to the error-with-filename reporting being rolled-in.</p>


	<p>Thanks in advance, as always.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Hi Steve,</p>


	<p>You can get any version from SVN by referring to its tag, which by convention is the version number:</p>


<pre>
$ svn checkout svn://dev.exiv2.org/svn/tags/&lt;version&gt;
</pre>

	<p>Use <a href="http://dev.exiv2.org/projects/exiv2/repository/show/tags" class="external">any tag</a> as the &lt;version&gt;, e.g.,</p>


<pre>
$ svn checkout svn://dev.exiv2.org/svn/tags/0.19
</pre>

	<p>Alternatively, you can also still download all the previously released tarballs and executables from the <a href="http://www.exiv2.org/archive.html" class="external">archive</a></p>


	<p>Please be careful with the terminology, to avoid confusion. There is no Exiv2 release 0.19.1. Maybe Ubuntu had such a package (then it would probably have been called 0.19-1), but the Exiv2 project never released a version 0.19.1 and you won't be able to get Ubuntu packages from the Exiv2 SVN or archive. Also, there is no Exiv2 version 0.2.0, do you mean 0.20? That's the latest released version of Exiv2.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Andreas,</p>


	<p>Thanks for the correction on 0.2.0 versus 0.20. It's the latter I meant, not the former. Moving on....</p>


	<p>There is <em>no</em> version 0.19.1?<br />I get this from my working Cygwin one on a <strong>-v</strong> command:<br /><pre>
&gt;&gt; exiv2 -V
exiv2 0.19.1
Copyright (C) 2004-2009 Andreas Huggel.
</pre></p>


	<p>In Cygwin I had 0.19 running, then you made the changes to include the <strong>-g</strong> command and added the namespaces for iView MP/MS Expression Media, all in the same build. I SVN'd that and now I'm looking to do the same for the version running on my Linux laptop. Might it have been only a temporary "snapshot" or "test" build? If so, it's done me very well these several months: my SVN folder shows <em>it</em> was last modified on April 19 of this year.</p>


	<p>BTW: the latest version available via the Ubuntu repositories is 0.18 (this gleaned after many apt-get updates, both in terminal and via Synaptic Package Manager). That Canonical might have had an "unofficial" 0.19-1 in its repos is therefore highly unlikely; my Ubu version is two behind the latest, so I won't rule it out entirely. Such a thing was, however, not made available to me. And anyway, it was in Cygwin, not Ubuntu GNOME, that I saw (and from the c&#38;p above am still seeing) the *.1 in that version number. Just to avoid confusion.</p>


	<p>In the meantime, I'll try the steps you described in the last post to this thread and see what results I get. Maybe between April and now, the whole of version 0.19 equated to all the commands, patches and bug corrections (originally?) offered in your repos as 0.19.1. Time and trial will tell. don't want to "roll back" the version on my laptop, either, but if it was all 0.19, I might not be doing anything of the sort.</p>


	<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Right, we temporarily had 0.19.1 in the repository. That sort of thing helps application developers test their apps during the development of a new release. So yes, if you have a revision from SVN, that may have version 0.19.1. But there was never an officially released version 0.19.1, it became 0.20 and I recommend you upgrade to that.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Well, I was able to take the Ubuntu laptop to version 0.20 with no problems so far: at least no "can't find {long-string-with-altogether-too-new-release-number-at the-end}.so" -- typical of previous Ubu installs -- or stack-dumping (you'll recall my mentioning that w/re my attempt to install same on Cygwin). Time will tell, but there oughtn't be any too-big issues. At least now the laptop has a version that includes the "-g" option.</p>


	<p>I read in the repository pages about the new error-trapping. It sounds great, but I'd like to be able to see it "in action" on my Windows box in Cygwin. Have there been any patches made (per complaints like mine and Matthias Baas') to the tarball for v.0.20 since it was first made, or would I be better off trying again with an SVN snapshot?</p>

	<p>Can I help you?  I've lost the plot a little here.  I seldom have any difficulty building exiv2 on Cygwin or Ubuntu or Mac.  Universal builds on the Mac are a little troublesome, however I don't think you're concerned. The code builds on Windows using most (all?) of Microsoft's versions of DevStudio - including the free DevStudio C++ Express editions (7.1/2003 and up).</p>


	<p>I've just done a sync with the repos and built on Cygwin.  I've pulled down the 0.20 tarball. Both build without any difficulty.</p>


	<p>Anyway, I'm happy to help you by building stuff, zipping it, and putting it on clanmills.com for you, if you think that would help you.  If I can't build something for you, I'm willing to investigate.  Let me know: <a class="email" href="mailto:robin@clanmills.com">robin@clanmills.com</a></p>

	<p>Steve,</p>


	<p>That means that the symbol visibility thing (<a class="issue tracker-2 status-5 priority-4 priority-default closed" title="Feature: C++ symbol visibility support for gcc builds (Closed)" href="/issues/523">#523</a>) is not supported on this platform. You can manually disable it to avoid the warnings by adding a --disable-visibility option to the ./configure step. The resulting exiv2 utility works the same, with or without this feature.</p>


	<p>Before you rebuild, could you send me the config.log and config/config.h files from your last build to investigate?</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Andreas,</p>


	<p>After that last build attempt yesterday, I trashed all previous source files, SVN folders and the like associated with version 0.20. I did another svn checkout download, and used your suggestion on the --disable-visiblity option at the ./configure stage. Attached you should find a .zip with the files you requested.</p>


	<p>On this run (./configure,make,make install) there was not a lot of difference in the result. <strong>exiv2 -V</strong> still threw that error I specified in my previous post. This time, at least, I know it's not my cmake, make or anything else from the Cygwin setup. If I had to make a guess, I'd say it's running into mixed-and-matched DLLs or something.</p>


	<p>Back to the drawing board, so to speak.</p>

	<p>Steve,</p>


	<p>That means that the symbol visibility thing (<a class="issue tracker-2 status-5 priority-4 priority-default closed" title="Feature: C++ symbol visibility support for gcc builds (Closed)" href="/issues/523">#523</a>) is not supported on this platform. You can manually disable it to avoid the warnings by adding a --disable-visibility option to the ./configure step. The resulting exiv2 utility works the same, with or without this feature.</p>


	<p>Before you rebuild, could you send me the config.log and config/config.h files from your last build to investigate?</p>

	<p>Robin Mills got the full story in an email, but suffice it to say that "massaging" the system memory by way of a boot-time scan with Avast! antivirus cured whatever problems Cygwin was having making use of the 0.20 install.</p>
