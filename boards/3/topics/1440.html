<h2>GSoC 2013 (Google Summer of Code)</h2>

<div class="message">
<p><span class="author">Added by <a class="user active" href="/users/119">Robin Mills</a> <a title="13 Feb 2013 21:29" href="/projects/exiv2/activity?from=2013-02-13">almost 9 years</a> ago</span></p>
<div class="wiki">
<p>In 2012, the Exiv2 project enjoyed having a GSoC student join us.  GSoC is "Google Summer of Code". Students are generously sponsored by Google to undertake open source projects during their University summer vacation/recess.</p>


	<p>The project added support for 4 video formats to Exiv2 and was undertaken by Abhinav Badola, supervised/mentored by Andreas and Gilles.  The guru of all meta-data, Phil Harvey said in advance: "I feel sorry for the poor soul assigned to this task. Video metadata is a real hairball.". <a class="external" href="http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/813">http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/813</a></p>


	<p>Abhinav added the following code:<br /><pre>
508 rmills@rmills-imac:~/gnu/exiv2/exiv2.master $ find . | grep video | xargs wc -l
     753 ./src/asfvideo.cpp
     185 ./src/asfvideo.hpp
     762 ./src/matroskavideo.cpp
     157 ./src/matroskavideo.hpp
    1600 ./src/quicktimevideo.cpp
     253 ./src/quicktimevideo.hpp
    1205 ./src/riffvideo.cpp
     215 ./src/riffvideo.hpp
      48 ./test/video-test.sh
    5178 total
509 rmills@rmills-imac:~/gnu/exiv2/exiv2.master $ 
</pre><br />And I'm sure there were additional code changes elsewhere in the code base to support this effort.</p>


	<p>Shawn and I became involved late in the project and submitted small changes (about 20 lines, I think) to persuade everything to build, run, pass the test suite using MSVC (32 and 64 bit), Cygwin and Clang.</p>


	<p>From my point of view, I observed:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>The code was neat, tidy, documented and readable</li>
		<li>He's a pleasant and agreeable person with whom to talk and work</li>
		<li>He totally finished the job</li>
	<ul>
	<li>added code to the test harness</li>
		<li>took advantage of the forum to collect 50mb of test files from users</li>
		<li>supported the porting to MSVC, Cygwin and Clang.</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ol>


	<p>Thank You, Abhinav.  Great Work.</p>


	<p><ins><i><em></i></em>_______________________________________________________________________________</ins></p>


	<p>And now it's 2013 and Gilles has asked "What about GSoc 2013?"</p>


	<p>I'm willing to run the treadmill of KDE/Google (essential) bureaucracy.  However we have to nominate and define a project.  The purpose of this topic is to discuss possible projects.  In the spirit of open-source, the team has agreed to discuss this openly on the forum.  Anyone may contribute ideas, suggestions, and criticism if they wish.    Possible projects are:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Support for more video formats</li>
		<li>Support for WebP (and/or WebM) format</li>
		<li>Better CMake support (especially for MSVC)</li>
		<li>I/O support for web protocols (http in particular)</li>
		<li>Investigate strategies to harness more exiftool Perl-based technology into exiv2 C++ codebase</li>
		<li>Remote build server</li>
	</ol>


We shouldn't discuss students in this thread for a couple of reasons:
	<ul>
	<li>The application process is Google's business</li>
		<li>We shouldn't discuss individuals in public without their prior knowledge and consent</li>
	</ul>


	<p>And finally, I'd like to suggest that we "fork" additional threads from here to discuss individual projects in detail.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I've received the following information from Abhinav concerning support for various formats.</p>


	<p>Currently supported formats are: <br />- avi, divx (RIFF format)<br />- mkv, WebM (Matroska format)<br />- mp4, mov, 3gp (QuickTime format)<br />- wmv, asf (Windows Media Format)</p>


	<p>Video Formats: MPEG and WebM</p>


	<p>- <strong>WebM</strong> implemented during last year's project. It is a type which uses Matroska container format and tags.<br />- <strong>MPEG</strong>, definitely needs to be added.</p>


	<p>Image Formats: WebP (Google) and JPEG-XR (Microsoft)</p>


	<p>- <strong>WebP</strong> should be added, as it is also RIFF based. But I was not able to find enough documentation last time.<br />Moreover, I was not able to get good sample images to test upon. I mean, the images (their extension was .bin, if I remember correctly) that I downloaded from the samples listed on their website, didn't contain enough metadata that can be processed or used for testing.<br />As far as I hope, exiv2 should be able to extract data from WebP images as well, since RIFF implementation was complete. I will need proper samples to confirm this.</p>


	<p>- <strong>JPEG-XR</strong> is a TIFF contained image format (source of information  - <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_XR">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_XR</a>).<br />I assume this would already be supported by the Exiv2. Is my assumption right, Andreas..?</p>


	<p>Robin's Summary of Abhinav's input:<br />- Add <strong>MPEG</strong> support<br />- Collect test files for <strong>WebM</strong>, <strong>WebP</strong>,* JPEG-XR* and validate our support for those formats</p>


	<p>Robin's other thoughts about other formats: <br />- There have been questions recently on the forum about write-support for <strong>CRW</strong>.<br />- And perhaps we should validate our support for <strong>JPEG2000</strong><br />- What about <strong>DNG</strong> ?<br />- What about <strong>PDF</strong> ?</p>


	<p>Thanks for this input, Abhinav.  Please let me know if I've misrepresented your thoughts (and my additions).</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I'd like to my thoughts about better CMake support (especially for MSVC)</p>


	<p>I spend time on this matter in 2012.  Building on the existing CMake support provided by Gilles, I succeeded to get various versions of Visual Studio to buile Exiv2 to build and pass the test suite:</p>


	<table>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td> 2003 </td>
			<td> 2005 </td>
			<td> 2008 </td>

			<td> 32 &#38; 64 </td>
			<td> 32 &#38; 64 </td>
			<td> 32 &#38; 64 </td>
			<td> not available </td>
		</tr>
	</table>




	<p>I was able to build DLL/static in Debug/Release</p>


	<p>Outstanding matters to be resolved concerning Visual Studio/CMake support (see TODO-CMAKE)<br />1 Detection of existing builds of expat and zlib<br />- I resolved this with the unhappy method of defining where the code must exist in the build tree<br />2 Out of source build support is weak and needs more testing.</p>


	<p>Other platforms<br />I regularly build and test Exiv2 on MacOSX and Cygwin with CMake.  I don't recall using CMake on MinGW.</p>


	<p>Other ideas concerning CMake<br />CMake could provide us with build support in Eclipse, Xcode, CodeBlocks, QtCreator and probably other IDEs.</p>


	<p>Challenges:<br />1) Finish the MSVC build matrix and get everything tested and documented.<br />- digiKam and other gnu projects would like to see solid support for this</p>


	<p>2) This is rather tedious and not very interesting<br />- mind you, that describes a lot of software work!</p>


	<p>3) We're now supporting 5 different editions of Visual Studio.<br />- Finding individuals with (legal) access to all those compilers could be a challenge.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Project Proposal - JSON and Scripting Support</p>


	<p>5 years ago, I became interested in exiv2 to implement a GeoTagging application.  I decided to use Python as an excuse to learn the language.  I used the pyexiv2 wrapper, written by Olivier, and the project was a success.  Building exiv2 and pyexiv2 on Windows and MacOSX was a challenge (to say the least).</p>


	<p>Since then, I've worked steadily on the exiv2 msvc and msvc64 built environments and I believe both are working very well.</p>


	<p>Sadly, building pyexiv2 is remains a challenge because it requires boost and the scons build utility.  (scons is/was another GSoC project.) The consequence is that my python script seldom uses the latest exiv2 and is not available on all my machines (Windows/Cygwin/Mac/Kubuntu).  The script is stable (hardly been changed in 5 years), however building the pyexiv2 wrapper is a maintenance challenge.  The pyexiv2 has to be built for specific versions of python (2.6, 2.7 etc), architecture (32/64 bit), platform (windows/cygwin/macosx/linux).</p>


	<p>This is not a criticism of Olivier's pyexiv2 wrapper.  Olivier has done a very good job.  Python wrappers which link C++ are a severe maintenance challenge.  I haven't worked for years with Perl's C++ support (XS and/or SWIG), however I anticipate similar pain and trouble.</p>


	<p>JSON to the rescue.  My proposal is to provide a JSON interface to read and write meta-data in the exiv2 command-line utility.</p>


	<p>As an sample application to prove our JSON support, provide wrappers for Perl and Python.  The wrappers can be written entirely in the scripting language and use the language's JSON support.  There is no need to get involved with C++ integration challenges such as boost/scons/pyexiv2, xs and swig.  When reading from files, the wrapper will call exiv2.exe ONCE to capture all JSON to file.  When writing to files, the wrapper will call exiv2.exe ONCE.  This strategy will enable the wrappers to and run on all platforms on which exiv2.exe is available.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Proposal: I/O support for web protocols (http in particular)</p>


	<p>Today we provide support files available on the file system. These files can be memory mapped if this feature is supported by the host OK.</p>


	<p>With the increasing interest in "cloud" computing, it's become ever more common for files to reside in remote locations which are not mapped to the file system.  Very common cases today are ftp and http.  For example: <a class="external" href="http://bla/bla/bla/file.jpg">http://bla/bla/bla/file.jpg</a>.  Today there are a myriad of "Cloud" storage products, such as AWS, DropBox, Google Drive, Sky Drive, Box,iCloud,  Just Cloud and more.</p>


	<p>The proposal is to support http, ftp and ssh.  This can be done by creating new instance of the BasicIO abstract class.  The exiv2 command would accept filenames with a URL (in addition) to the local file system.  For example:<br /><pre>
exiv2 -pt http://clanmills.com/files/Robin.jpg
exiv2 -pt ftp://username@password:/clanmills.com/Robin.jpg
exiv2 -pt ssh://username@password:/clanmills.com/Robin.jpg
</pre></p>


	<p>In most image files, the meta-data is defined in the first 100k of the file, so the implementation should only read blocks on demand from the server and avoid copying the complete file. It's easy to envisage mobile applications to display an image preview and metadata, such as image size, data and GPS location.  Efficient protocol support can deliver performance and data at modest band-width consumption.  Another use case for this technology is a "metadata-server" web-service.  By supplying the URL of the image, the service can return metadata without copying the whole image.</p>


	<p>The simplest possible implementation of this proposal for exiv2 to detect the protocol and use a helper application such as curl or ssh.  This implementation probably requires copying the complete file from the remote storage to a temporary file in the local file system. While such an implementation can be constructed quickly, this does not satisfy the project aim to make efficient use of band-width.  It is very desirable to use a robust implementation of the web protocols and a library such as libcurl should be considered.  The selection of the protocol support library must respect build implications.  We should be careful to avoid adding a large library (such as boost) to the build dependancies.  Additionally, the implementation is required to be written in C++ and run on Mac/Windows/Linux without dependency on platform frameworks such as .Net, Java, or Cocoa.  It may be that build switches can be provided to enable Exiv2 to use platform frameworks.  This could be especially useful on mobile platforms such as Android and iOS.</p>


	<p>The implementation should provide bi-directional support (both read and write) with read-access being the first priority.</p>


	<p>Finally, an engineering assessment of the effort and technology to support "Cloud" storage (such as AWS and DropBox) should be part of this effort.  This assessment would provide a starting point for a future GSoC project.</p></div>

	<p>This looks like an interesting addition to the functionality of Exiv2.<br />I think the idea can be used to extend the reading and writing of the Metadata over the local network as well. I mean at home, I generally have PC that have different OS installed. So I think this feature can also be used over file sharing protocols such as, smb(samba) and nfs.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Indeed the protocols nfs: and smb: could be supported.  However because these protocols enable the user to map remote objects into the filesystem, support in exiv2 for those protocols doesn't provide unique/new functionality.</p>


An interesting extension is to enable exiv2 to run as a service (daemon) on a web socket.  I imagine two types of clients:
	<ol>
	<li>exiv2 itself of course</li>
		<li>JavaScript/WebSocket client</li>
	</ol>


	<p>To do this we could do something like this:<br /><pre>
Server:      # exiv2 --daemon --port 54321
Client:      $ exiv2 -pt exv://server:54321:/Robin.jpg
Even better: $ exiv2 -pt exv://server:54321:/http://clanmills.com/files/Robin.jpg
</pre>I don't want to get into detail concerning the JavaScript API for this.  Something like this:<br /><pre>

var exiv2     = new Exiv2( { server : 'clanmills.com' , port : 54321 }); 
var metadata  = eval(exiv2.command('--JSON -pt /Robin.jpg '));
// or even better
var metadata  = eval(exiv2.command('--JSON -pt http://clanmills.com/files/Robin.jpg'));
</pre>To get the most from this functionality, we should provide JSON (and/or XML) support which I discussed in an different proposal.</p>


	<p>However, a project to extend remote I/O support to take advantange of WebSockets seems like a future GSoC project.  That's one idea in my head when I proposed an engineering assessment of other "Cloud" technologies.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Proposal to add a new interface to Exiv2, to help add new lens.</p>


	<p>Many a times I have seen users and developers reporting missing lens information. They then have to post it on forum, or open up an issue under Exiv2. Then they have to wait for the developers to update the code so that they can proceed with their work and testing.</p>


	<p>It would be really great if we could add an interface to Exiv2, where it would allow users to add new lens information to their local Exiv2 installation.</p>


	<p>I mean if we could add some interface where user can temporarily add information to a local database and then access the information through Exiv2, as if the Lens information was actually existing in Exiv2.<br />This would temporarily facilitate the developer/user to continue on with their work, while we can work on the issue and resolve it.</p>


	<p>[1] We can create a separate text file, where the user can add Lens information in a predefined structured form.<br />or<br />[2] We can add some new command line parameters like --addlens<br />eg.-<br />exiv2 --addlens --id 255 --makernote "Canon" --lensname "Tokina New Lens To Be Added"</p>


	<p>Most of the times, our users are developers or experienced coders, and they directly edit the code and add the lens information themselves, in their local repository.<br />But this feature can help them save a lot of editing and compiling time as well.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I think this is a good idea and could be part of the project I proposed:  "Investigate strategies to harness more exiftool Perl-based technology into exiv2 C++ codebase"</p>


	<p>I know very little about exiftool, however I give it great respect. Phil supports many things that would be useful in exiv2.  Farming the lens library into the format you are suggest is a good idea.  Niels has recently joined the exiv2 developer team and has been dealing with lens and camera additions.</p>


	<p>I don't think I can write much in a proposal for the project: "Investigate strategies to harness more exiftool Perl-based technology into exiv2 C++ codebase".  The project is to investigate.  Implementation is another matter.  However your suggestion could be one component to be implemented.</p></div>

	<p>Proposal: I/O support for web protocols (http in particular)</p>


	<p>Today we provide support files available on the file system. These files can be memory mapped if this feature is supported by the host OK.</p>


	<p>With the increasing interest in "cloud" computing, it's become ever more common for files to reside in remote locations which are not mapped to the file system.  Very common cases today are ftp and http.  For example: <a class="external" href="http://bla/bla/bla/file.jpg">http://bla/bla/bla/file.jpg</a>.  Today there are a myriad of "Cloud" storage products, such as AWS, DropBox, Google Drive, Sky Drive, Box,iCloud,  Just Cloud and more.</p>


	<p>The proposal is to support http, ftp and ssh.  This can be done by creating new instance of the BasicIO abstract class.  The exiv2 command would accept filenames with a URL (in addition) to the local file system.  For example:<br />[...]</p>


</blockquote>

	<p>This seems like a more required feature to me.<br />Now a days we all have smart/advanced mobile phones which have awesome cameras. With the advent of Android devices more into the market, the photographs that one clicks is directly uploaded to cloud services or facebook or google+ or dropbox.<br />I would take example of my phone, where the photographs that I click are uploaded and synced with my google+ or facebook account.</p>


	<p>I did some search on the net and found out that this type of feature can be used to handle request like these as well. (<a class="external" href="http://www.digikam.org/node/519">http://www.digikam.org/node/519</a>. I am referring to the question specified in the comment). One of the ways to solve his problem could have been, if he could have got the privilege to access and modify metadata on the cloud service itself. As such digikam also provides uploading of images to various online services like Picasa, flickr, and so on. I think it would be really awesome if we could provide a feature to access and edit metadata online over different protocols (of-course with proper authentication and authorization fields).</p>


	<p>Gilles, Andreas,<br />please give your feedback on the feasibility of this idea.<br />In my opinion, it could be a hit and an added advantage, which should be extended to digikam as well.</p></div>
