<p>Hi</p>


	<p>I looked through forum notes, and I see that this bug has come up before. Is there now a fix or a workaround for it?</p>


	<p>I'm using exiv2 0.24 on Windows 7 professional (64bit)</p>


	<p>Works great for small files<br />But now that I'm tagging 65M tiff files, I'm getting the intermittent failures others have reported with the error message listed in the subject line</p>


	<p>Any suggestions? I have 1000's of files to tag!</p>


	<p>I call exiv2 via a system call from a perl script. Code fragment is below.</p>


	<p>sub tagPhoto{<br />    my ($repeatFlag, $destPhoto, $mapFile, %genAddressLine) = @_;<br />    my $cmd;<br />    my $tag;<br />    my $exiv2Exe = "exiv2.exe";<br />    my $tagKeyword = "Iptc.Application2.Keywords";<br />    my $address;</p>
	<pre><code>#construct tag<br />    $tag = sprintf("AAPS-houseNumber:%04d-streetName:%s-sheetNumber:%04d-rollNumber:%02d-dateTaken:%s", <br />    $genAddressLine{"houseNumber"},<br />    $genAddressLine{"streetName"},<br />    $genAddressLine{"sheetNumber"},<br />    $genAddressLine{"negativeNumber"},<br />    $genAddressLine{"dateTaken"} );</code></pre>
	<pre><code>if($repeatFlag == 0) {<br />    $cmd = sprintf("-M\"set $tagKeyword $tag\"");<br />    }<br />    else {<br />    $cmd = sprintf("-M\"add $tagKeyword $tag\"");<br />    }</code></pre>
	<pre><code>system("$exiv2Exe $cmd \"$destPhoto\"");<br />}</code></pre>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Thomas:<br />Thanks for mentioning this.  I also wondered if <a class="changeset" title="Issue: 984.  Thanks, Thomas.  I should not have modified your code.  You were correct.  My apolog..." href="/projects/exiv2/repository/exiv2/revisions/3350">r3350</a> could be the fix for the rename puzzle.  The point about the virus checker is interesting.  When we open the file, we'll unwittingly trigger a file system change notification which we get the attention of the virus checker.  For longer files - 60mb tiffs and video, it seems a good hunch that the virus checker and Exiv2 tussle for ownership of the file.</p>


	<p>George:<br />It would be very helpful for you to run tests with your virus checker on/off.  I know it's a bother to backup all your photos for testing purposes - however your contribution would be appreciated.  Remember, I have never seen this error - so we really need to get this issue isolated and into a state in which we can reproduce with strong reliability (preferably 100% chance of reproducing it).</p>


	<p>Thomas:<br />Do you have time to revisit issue984.cpp and get it to call execvp while holding a lock?</p>


	<p>Good Teamwork here, guys.  We'll nail this little guy - he's in our sights.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Ha!  I think I got you a good lead on nailing this one</p>


	<p>As it happens, I went to my machine to turn of virus checking only to find out that it has been disabled for a few weeks (a different problem for me to address!)</p>


	<p>So I started to look for other apps that might have some conflict w/ files</p>


	<p>I have dropbox on my machine, and I have an app call hightail (for sending large files to people).</p>


	<p>Turn dropbox app off, and exiv2 works just fine on the tifs. Turn dropbox on, and I get errors. Turn dropbox back off and it runs just fine.</p>


	<p>I'll try it on a bigger sample (it will take a while) just to test out this idea a little more, but I'd say whatever dropbox is doing to watch files is screwing with exiv2</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>My longer test of 100's of tif files worked when dropbox was disabled</p>


	<p>I also tried the same test with the hightail file watcher. Same behavior - clashed with exiv2 when active - fine when deactivated</p>


	<p>So I think I have a perfectly good workaround for me</p>


	<p>Hopefully this helps you guys nail down the problem for real. If there is anything else you want me to try like running a debug version of exiv2, just let me know</p>

	<p>This teamwork stuff really works.  It's Thomas who thought of the virus checker and provided a patch for it.  That patch has been submitted, however the trunk is currently broken on MSVC builds.  We're working to fix the build of course.</p>


	<p>I suspect Thomas' fix for this will also solve your interesting find about the Explorer.</p>

Thank You Thomas for suggesting a ..." href="/projects/exiv2/repository/exiv2/revisions/3354">r3354</a> and test with that.  I know that build is OK (passes our test harness on all platforms).

	<p>Yes. <a class="external" href="http://clanmills.com/files/Exiv2-Win32-ReleaseDLL-r3359.zip">http://clanmills.com/files/Exiv2-Win32-ReleaseDLL-r3359.zip</a>  Copy exiv2.exe and the 3'dlls (exiv2, libexpat and zlib1) to any directory and you should be able to execute exiv2.exe</p>


	<p>One of the projects in progress for Exiv2 v0.25 is a Build Server created using Jenkins. <a class="external" href="http://exiv2.dyndns.org:8080">http://exiv2.dyndns.org:8080</a></p>


	<p>I'll check the box for "Keep build artifacts" and see what happens and update this thread.  Going forward, the server will retain "old" builds.  The Jenkins work is in development and I haven't bothered to try this option yet.  However your request is a good reason to start using this.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Thanks for the update, George.  That's very interesting about Explorer.  I've found ProcExp (from sysinternals.com) is very useful for debugging stuff like this. If you know which file is involved, you can get ProcExp to watch him.  There are many other great utilities sysinternals.com for monitoring the filesystem, sockets, registry and all manner of "under the hood" stuff.</p>


	<p>I'm very pleased that r3359.zip is working for you.  I'm off the hook for the moment in getting you another build!  The build server said "don't know what artefacts to archive" or something equally hopeless.  I'll have to work on this.  Sadly I murdered the Build Server's Windows Build VM by mistake.  I'll get a new VM running and debug the artefacts publishing at the weekend.</p>


	<p>Thanks for persevering with this, George.  The toughest part of many bugs is correctly identifying the issue and having a solid way to reproduce it.  Your efforts are very helpful.  Thank You.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Hi robin</p>


	<p>My s/w days are well over, but I'll experiment with procexp<br />The problem is that out of a test case of even only 20 files, it's completely unpredictable as to which file will get the errno=17 message</p>


	<p>I'm out of town till fri, and will have some time to experiment over the weekend</p>


	<p>Any thing in particular you'd want me to monitor/ capture while running procexp?</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Gosh, I can't really say exactly what to monitor.  If you find a collection of 20 files that "bomb" the code, that's wonderful.  You can push them on a server somewhere (Google Docs?), or send me a DVD.  If I can reproduce this, that's a huge step in the right direction.</p>


	<p>We can talk 1-to-1 at the weekend on Skype if you wish.  In which time-zone are you?  I'm in England.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Hi robin</p>


	<p>I could totally zip up the files and my perl script for you this weekend.</p>


	<p>Please email me your address at <a class="email" href="mailto:gswan@perforce.com">gswan@perforce.com</a> and I'll send it</p>


	<p>I live in california so there will be 8 hours of time difference. We can chat/ Skype</p>


	<p>I'll try running my script on a different PC to see if I can reproduce there also. The PC I currently use is pretty high end and I wonder if the conflict is timing dependent</p>


	<p>My experience with running my script is that if  I am going to see the conflict, I'm going to see it happen within the first ~10-20 files</p></div>

	<p>Thank you for your private emails about this matter.  Regrettably, we haven't isolated this issue.  It's either been fixed (by Thomas Fix in <a class="external" href="http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/984">http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/984</a>), or it will resurface and we'll capture him at that time.</p>


	<p>I appreciate the effort you have put into this and look forward to having lunch with you when I'm California later in October.</p>


	<p>Robin</p></div>
