<h2>DOS batch file and EXIF date stamps</h2>

<div class="wiki">
<p>Hi!<br />I'm currently building a batch file and I need some help.<br />Here's the story: I have many scanned files that contain absolutely no EXIF data and I am building a batch file to run exiv2 with pre-programmed commands to do the most regular chores.<br />One of the problems I run into is that I need to set date stamps but I run into a specific problem that is annoying me.<br />Thing is, to set the date I must use the yyy:mm:dd hh:mm:ss format but the required colons (:) are a reserved character in DOS batch files...<br />Does anyone have any idea of how to go around this?</p>


	<p>I'm running under Windows 10.</p>


	<p>Thanks</p>

I can't remember the last time I noticed anything new in DOS.  It's been very static for about 20 years.  My wife's laptop runs 10 and I can have a sniff around on that if you're still in trouble.</p></div>

	<p>Yes, I'm running the good old cmd.exe dos prompt. I figured that it's old and cruddy enough so that my script will run on anything.<br />the problem that I'm running into is that in a batch file, the : is considered as a command all by itself, so I have to work around that.<br />I'm starting to think that the only way around would be to create a text file containing all the commands, send it through exiv2 and then delete it. But that's proving to be a real pain... but it might be the only way around this.</p>


	<p>Right now, just getting the system date in the proper order is proving to be another problem... but at least once this part is written, the rest should come in easy.</p></div>

Many folks think DOS is unusable - although I'm not a member of the Microsoft hate brigade.  I like Windows.</p>


	<p>I've also heard people say great things about PowerShell.  I've never wanted to use PS because it's M/S only.  I seldom work exclusively on Windows.  When I write scripts, I usually want then to run on any platform.  I like bash/cygwin.  I've found python to be a very nice cross-platform environment.  For example the msvc2005/configure.bat script in the Exiv2 build system.</p>


	<p>There's an Exiv2 user in Silicon Valley who has a scanning business.  I think he has scripts for a lot of this stuff.  I could put you in touch with him and maybe you can collaborate.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>DOS is definitely the underdog of the programming world, but I think that's why I like it.<br />A long time ago I used to do a lot of stuff in classic Visual Basic but I got tired of it. While it does make nice interfaces, I like the smallness of script files. They rarely get to be incompatible with some system update and don't need a ton of junk just to run.</p>


	<p>Right now, I think I may be on my way to figuring some way to bypass the problems... as they say, simplify until it doesn't work and start from there. I'm thinking my script might have been overly complicated. I found out that for some reason it doesn't like to set values in an IF block... I call it quirkiness.</p></div>

	<p>For sure the DOS '(' and ')' for if and stuff is a very slippery customer.  I agree with your comments about VB.  Nice people don't let their friends use VB.  VB = Very brittle.  However making a little GUI in VB is fun and you can use it to launch your batch file.  However, only do fluffy gui stuff in VB.  Invest your effort in durable/fixable code.</p></div>

	<p>Apologies in advance for a bit of an OT reply, but I'm always interested in seeing how people handle dates for their images. The Metadata Working Group has some information and guidelines on which tags are which and includes recommendations for scanned images.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Thanks for the link.<br />I'm going to check it out for sure as I want my images to be properly read by software and websites.</p>


	<p>As for now, my metadata handling is primitive at best. I often feel some tags are harder to get correct than others.<br />For instance, I always slave over the aperture info and the date gave me hell. Shutter speed is another one...</p>


	<p>Anyways, I'll check it out.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Aperture is a tricky customer - it's stored as a rational - however converting to a decimal is wrong.  It's an APEX number.  The exiv2(.exe) application knows what to do with the syntax Fn.m to convert it to an Apex rational.  <a class="external" href="http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/1039">http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/1039</a></p>


	<p>As Alan says, dates are another black art.  The Exif standard does not include Time Zone information.  I also believe it does <em><strong>not</strong></em> handle time resolution less than than 1 second and that's a bummer when processing bracketed images (for HDR).  I think there's an Exif standard for sub seconds, however this is all messy.  Xmp follows the better XML date/time standard.  <a class="external" href="http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/1112">http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/1112</a></p>


	<p>I can't say much about exposure.  Shutter speed (Exif.Photo.ExposureTime) is stored as a rational second.  There was an issue recently relating to this.  <a class="external" href="http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/935">http://dev.exiv2.org/issues/935</a></p>


	<p>I've dumped the exposure data from a photo I took in July at Stonehenge.  It has all this EV stuff which I think is a setting on the camera to under/overexpose.  And mostly in the Nikon MakerNotes from my D5300.    I'm a retired Adobe Software Engineer and joined Team Exiv2 to add MSVC support.  I've been on a 7 year adventure into the mysterious land of metadata and still have a great deal to learn.  <pre>$ exiv2 -pa -g Exposure http://dev.exiv2.org/attachments/download/805/DSC_7154.jpg

$ </pre>I suspect however you don't need to throw too much metadata into scanned images.  If you're scanning, what does exposure and aperture mean?  To be useful, you really need to capture that data when the photo was taken.  If you're scanning an old slide from years back, it's probably impossible to even guess most of the stuff that's effortlessly stored by a digital camera.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Yes, it is for scanning old negatives.<br />The good thing is I know which lenses were used so I can set the lens mm, focal length equivalent and maximum aperture pretty easily.<br />Exposure mode, flash on/off are another one I can easily set without much knowledge.</p>


	<p>Thing is I regularly scan stuff and then use AnalogEXIF to add the tags back in. But this program hasn't seen any development in ages and contains more than a few bugs, some of them intermittent and mysterious... the type of stuff we all hate. On the other hand, EXIV2 has been around for quite some time (I used to use it back when it didn't support XML) so I naturally migrated to it and am attempting to rebuild the same functionality as analogexif but in a bulletproof batch file.</p></div>
