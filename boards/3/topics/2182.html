<p>I'm a very green user. I downloaded the Windows version and unzipped the files. I put them in my Program Files folder on both my HD.</p>


	<p>I want to find the preview images in a NEF file. When I try to execute:</p>


	<p>exiv2 -p p filename, I get a message that says "exiv2 is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."</p>


	<p>Only if I locate the exiv2.exe and libexpat.dll files in the folder where the image is located do I get past this error!</p>


	<p>But then I get another error: "Failed to open the file" [the image file].</p>


	<p>Can someone explain what I have done wrong?</p>


	<p>BTW, I could not use Chrome to access this forum. Chrome does not show the "New Message" or "Watch" links! :-(</p>

	<p>The reason it works in the same directory as the image is because Windows always searches the current directory before searching the directories defined in the PATH environment string.</p>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I am now stumped trying to extract a Preview image. I went to the manpage and it said:</p>


	<p>-e tgt<br />Extract target(s) for the 'extract' action. Possible targets are the same as those for the -d option, plus a target to extract preview images and a modifier to generate an XMP sidecar file: <br />p[&lt;n&gt;[,&lt;m&gt; ...]] : Extract preview images. The optional comma separated list of preview image numbers is used to determine which preview images to extract. The available preview images and their numbers are displayed with the 'print' option -pp.</p>


	<p>That is a bit cryptic. I can't deduce the syntax! I have tried the following in an attempt to extract Preview1:</p>


	<p>exiv2 -e p filename [1]<br />exiv2 -e p [1] filename<br />exiv2 -e p filename [&lt;1&gt;]<br />exiv2 -e p [&lt;1&gt;] filename<br />exiv2 -e p filename 1<br />exiv2 -e p 1 filename<br />exiv2 -e filename p [1]</p>


	<p>None of these seem to "extract" the Preview. <br />Several times it also returns:</p>


	<p>Usage: exiv2 [ options ][ action ] file ...</p>


	<p>This implies strongly that the correct syntax is: exiv2 -e p filename, which returns a series of 4 questions like:</p>


	<p>exiv2: Overwrite '.\filename-preview1.tif'?</p>


	<p>I answered "n" to these questions.</p>


	<p>But that last syntax doesn't have any of the [&lt;n&gt;] which specify which Preview image to extract.</p>


	<p>When I add &lt;1&gt; to the end, it returns: "The syntax of the command is incorrect."</p>


	<p>Adding "1" to the end generates the 4 questions.</p>


	<p>Adding "Preview1" to the end generates the 4 questions.</p>


	<p>Adding "&lt;Preview1&gt;" to the end returns incorrect syntax message as before.</p>


	<p>I can't think of what else to try!</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>Robin, I appreciate your response. Sadly, it confuses me, perhaps more than I already was!</p>


	<p>Let's start with the first line in your example; What is "curl"? I looked all over the exiv2 website and never found that text! This must be some language and/or OS that I'm not using?</p>


	<p>I understand the second line in the example. However, it is dealing w/ a JPEG file, not a RAW file. That may not be significant or important?</p>


	<p><ins><strong>Line 3 is the best one!</strong></ins> Your syntax is to run the "-e", "p", and "1" together! I tried that: exiv2 -ep1 dsc_2808.nef</p>


	<p>It returned the question: exiv2: overwrite '.\dsc_2808-preview1.tif'?</p>


	<p>What is going on? Your example didn't show this response!!! I don't want to overwrite preview1!!!</p>


	<p>I think your fourth line is also confusing. When I tried that with my subject directory, the result was completely different than what you showed! Again, that may be because you are using a different OS?</p>


	<p>The results DID show 4 "preview" files. This is good, but they were dated yesterday. That means that one of my fumbling attempts actually worked, but I was not aware that it worked. I deleted the 4 previews and tried the "exiv2 <del>ep1 dsc_2808.nef" command again. I got no "overwrite?" message. I now understand that message; it was asking me if I wanted to overwrite the EXTERNAL preview file(s), not the INTERNAL preview files. I checked and indeed that command string DID create a "dsc_2808-review1.tif" file. :</del>)</p>


	<p>You HAVE answered my query about syntax...sorta. I wondered which of the dozen or so syntaxes that I attempted worked to create the 4 preview files that I found this AM? Since I had not used the exact syntax that you suggested, something else must have been parsed correctly by exiv2. I tried:</p>


	<p>"exiv2 -e p1 dsc_2808.nef"...it worked, so not necessary to put the "-e" and "p1" together<br />"exiv2 -e p 1 dsc_2808.nef"...gave a "failed to open file" message, but DID create 4 preview images!<br />"exiv2 -e p1, p2 dsc_2808.nef"...got an "unrecognized extract target ','" message...no previews created<br />"exiv2 -e p1,p2 dsc_2808.nef"...that worked to extract and create the first 2 preview images</p>


	<p>I think I now GET IT. As you probably know by now, the manpage is not much help. In fact, it suggested that the "[&lt;1&gt;]" structure was NECESSARY. That it might be harmful is a travesty! The error messages also parrot this confusing syntax: "Usage: exiv2 [ options ] [ action ] file ..." w/o any explanation about what the "[]" syntax means! I'm guessing that "[]" indicate "optional" elements, or something? No clue about the "<>"!</p>


	<p>Thanks for all your help.</p></div>

	<p>curl is a program to get files from the internet to your disk drive.  It has many many features, however the command:<pre>curl http://dev.exiv2.org/attachments/download/805/DSC_7154.jpg &gt; Stonehenge.jpg</pre>copies a file from the internet and puts it into the file Stonehenge.jpg.  You can achieve this result by put the URL (<a class="external" href="http://...DSC_7154.jpg">http://...DSC_7154.jpg</a>) into your browser and when the photo has finished loading, you can save it by right-clicking and "Save Image".  The command "curl" is effectively "See URL" (however it's normally verbalised as curl (as in hair).</p>


	<p>exiv2 -pp Stonehenge.jpg simply lists the previews in the image.  In this case there is only one.  I've downloaded the image:  _DSC4176.NEF from <a class="external" href="http://www.mannyphoto.com/D700D3/">http://www.mannyphoto.com/D700D3/</a>   Here's what I see:<pre>$ exiv2 -pp _DSC4176.NEF

$ </pre>While it's true that I am using a Mac, these commands will work on Windows although the output of dir is a little different.</p>


	<p>I've never taken any interest in extracting previews.  I think the "Overwrite?" question concerns writing to your hard disk. There is an option <em><strong>-f</strong></em> to say "force the overwrite, don't ask".  So you can extract the previews with the command:<pre>exiv2 -f -ep _DSC4176.NEF</pre></p>


	<p>The exiv2 man page follows the UNIX conventions for expressing options.  <strong>[ arg ]</strong> means "This is optional".  <strong>{ a | b | c }</strong> means choose one.  [ arg ]+ means the argument can be repeated <strong>file ...</strong> means provide a file (and you may provide more).  So <strong>file ...</strong> is the same as [ file ]+.  I hope I haven't confused you.  I've no idea where these conventions are defined/documented.  I learned this stuff in Software Kinder-garden.  Regrettably these conventions are less known in the World of Windows (that's not a criticism of Windows).</p>


	<p>I didn't write the part of the man page that explains the -ep option,  I would have expressed that as:  -ep[num[,num]+] which would say "Option -ep  may be followed by a number. The number may also be followed by one of more ,number expressions.  So the following would be valid:<pre>-ep
-ep2
-ep2,1
-ep1,2,3</pre>You may be rather surprised by this, however this is <em>standard</em> notation.  I think when this part of the man page was written (probably by Andreas), he used &lt;n&gt; and &lt;m&gt; to convey what I would express as num.  I'm certain he didn't intend to mean that <em>greaterthan</em> (>) or <em>lessthan</em> (<) are to be on the command line.  In his defence, I'd like to point out that in the EXAMPLES at the bottom of the man page, he has provided the example:<pre>       exiv2 -ep1,2 image.jpg
          Extracts previews 1 and 2 from the image to the files image-pre-
          view1.jpg and image-preview2.jpg</pre>Alan has accepted the assignment to update the man page for v0.26.  I'm sure he'll appreciate help with proof reading.  Drop him an email - he'll be delighted to accept your input.</p>


	<p>I believe, in the world of recipes and cooking books, it's very difficult indeed to convey cooking instructions in words.  Software's just as difficult.  It doesn't help that many engineers find writing in English to be more difficult than C++.  The good news however is the Forum.  Unlike the recipe book, we provide a way for you to speak directly to the exiv2 engineers.  Our time and your input combine to make the world a better place.</p></div>

  <div class="wiki"><p>I knew that you were not trying to confuse me. Sadly, if you are from the UNIX and/or Mac world, it's unavoidable.</p>


	<p>Thanks for explaining "curl". I have no control over what the UNIX folks call their programs, but I find they are usually cryptically funny. Being a "normal" person, I would have written it "c-url" or "see-url"; not as cute, but less likely to confuse.</p>


	<p>I figured out what the "overwrite" message was about. I had already [accidently] created the 4 preview files. When I [accidently] attempted to do this again, the exiv2 program correctly asked if I wanted to "overwrite" the old files. Since I did not know that I had created anything, I was confused by this "overwrite" question; I incorrectly thought it was asking to overwrite the images INSIDE the NEF file.</p>


	<p>I must admit that I missed the "exiv2 -ep" example. I did look at them, just didn't see that one. My error!</p>


	<p>I understand the difficulty that many "geeks" have with languages, like English. It's sad that there is such a void! My wife is a very talented Technical Editor and has taught me a lot. There are two major errors in the "Examples" section:</p>


	<p>1. Lack of a consistent style...<br />2. Poor organization...</p>


	<p>Each example should START w/ a descriptive title, like "Extract Previews", followed by several examples, including a description of what each example does:</p>


	<p><strong>Extract Previews...</strong>	<p>exiv2 -ep1,2 image.jpg     extracts previews 1 and 2 from image.jpg and creates files image-preview1.jpg and image-preview2.jpg<br />     exiv2 -ep1 image.jpg       extracts preview 1 from image.jpg and creates file image-preview1.jpg<br />     exiv2 -ep image.jpg        extracts all previews from image.jpg and creates an image-previewN.jpg file for each</p>
</p>


	<p>I appreciate the Forum and your assistance. It is truly good news...</p></div>

	<p>Right.  I think we have this cleared up.  For sure the exiv2 man page and every single thing on the planet can be improved.  As I said, Alan has accepted to challenge in <a class="issue tracker-2 status-2 priority-4 priority-default" title="Feature: Exiv2 manpage overhaul (Assigned)" href="/issues/1061">#1061</a> to give it a make-over for v0.26.  The rather terse style of the man page is typical UNIX.  The GCC 4.9 compiler man page is a staggering 253 pages when printed to A4 pages.  It's a tough read.  That's the UNIX way.</p>


	<p>It's true that I've been working on Mac/Unix/Linux for a long time - however I'm quite happy to work on Windows.  I'm a retired Adobe Engineer.  I personally use Apple computers, however I run Linux and Windows on Virtual Machines running on the Mac.</p>


	<p>Please allow me to say something about how things get done in the world of open-source.  The team are all volunteers with full-time, demanding jobs (except me).  I could easily work 50 hours a week on the project, however I don't.  I have other uses for my time.  We don't have employees to whom tasks can be delegated.  Everything depends on good will and contributions.  So, if you feel strongly that the man page should be rewritten, there is one guaranteed way to get that done: <em><strong>You volunteer</strong></em>.  (or perhaps your wife would like to volunteer).  And when/if you volunteer, you'll be surprised by the feedback and comments that appear on the forum.  No matter how much effort you put into the man page, you'll be surprised by some criticism.  That said however, open source is a worthwhile use of time and many of my interactions with users are pleasant and agreeable.  For sure, I include you in the "pleasant and agreeable" conversations.  And I wish to Thank You for having the manners to say "Thanks" for my response to your concerns.</p></div>
